        You might think this was invented to avoid all of that time-consuming wrapping and messy deep-frying, but it wasn't! It was invented by the keto people, because they can't eat egg roll wrappers-but this guy can. So, instead of what's really egg roll filling in a bowl, we're doing the real thing in all of its tasty and textural glory. Garnish with more green onions if desired.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>6 (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 ½ cups shredded green cabbage</li>
        <li>1 cup julienned carrot</li>
        <li>¼ cup julienned red bell pepper</li>
        <li>⅓ cup thinly sliced green onions</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sake</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly grated ginger</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon white pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ketchup</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Step</h3>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step</h3>
                <p>Cut wonton wrappers into 1/4-inch strips. Transfer cut wonton wrappers to a baking pan and toss with oil. Spread out evenly.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step</h3>
                <p>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 12 minutes. Let cool and reserve.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step</h3>
                <p>Combine cabbage, carrot, bell pepper, green onions, and garlic for the bowl. Set aside.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step</h3>
                <p>Mix soy sauce, rice vinegar, sake, sesame oil, sugar, ginger, cayenne, pepper, ketchup, and cornstarch together for sauce in a bowl and reserve.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step</h3>
                <p>Add pork to a large skillet set over medium-high heat. Brown the meat well, while breaking up into small crumbles as it cooks, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the vegetable mixture and toss with the meat to combine. Cook, stirring, just until the veggies start to soften, about 2 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step</h3>
                <p>Stir in the sauce and toss everything to combine. Cook and stir until the sauce has coated everything evenly, and the vegetables are cooked to desired doneness, 1 to 2 minutes more. Serve in a bowl with crispy wonton strips on top.</p>
